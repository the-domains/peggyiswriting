  Some days my super power would be being able to step into a photo. Provided I
  could step back out again! Right now, I wouldnâ€™t mind being somewhere else.
  Somewhere with a few cows is always a bonus. My husband says that is because I
  never worked with them and that is true. I have not. He has. A long time ago.
  Not in a galaxy far away though. Just somewhere outside town actually.

Some days my super power would be being able to step into a photo. Provided I could step back out again! Right now, I wouldn't mind being somewhere else. Somewhere with a few cows is always a bonus. My husband says that is because I never worked with them and that is true. I have not. He has. A long time ago. Not in a galaxy far away though. Just somewhere outside town actually.

Anyway, today I want to escape.
